Are persuasive text messages more effective when expressed in comic form? Text messages abound, asking us to act, either towards personal wellness goals (e.g. in an exercise app:``you need 2,000 more steps to reach 10,000 steps for the day''), reminders (e.g. push notifications from a task tracking app: ``pick up prescription from the pharmacy at 6PM''), or appeals from charities online (e.g. from a recent Wikipedia campaign on the Wikipedia page: ``If everyone reading this donated \$5 our fundraiser would end today. Please donate to keep Wikipedia free.''). Making these short text messages more effective has important implications in stimulating behavior, especially for non-profits and Governmental agencies interested in alleviating public goods dilemmas.

There is a rich history of prior work in Psychology that has examined how variations in the construction of the text message alter decisions. In a seminal paper,~\textcite{tversky1981framing} examined information framing: can we elicit different decisions, by describing the outcome either as a loss or a gain, even though the two messages are indistinguishable in terms of expected utility? They found that individuals are risk-seeking when confronted with certain loss and risk-averse in the presence of gains. Cialdini examined the introduction of social norms in two different contexts: towel re-use in hotels~\parencite{goldstein2008room}, reduction of power consumption~\parencite{schultz2007constructive}. In the former study, replacing the standard text message in hotels asking the customer to re-use towels, with the social norm (e.g. ``75\% of the people in this hotel have re-used their towels''), increased towel re-use. The latter study had an intriguing result---while introducing the social norm in the message \textit{did not} reduce overall energy consumption, adding emoticons to the message with the social norm made a difference. Specifically, they added a smiley face `\smiley{}' when the customer consumed less energy than average, and a frowny `\frownie{}' face when their energy consumption was worse than average. By adding emoticons average energy consumption decreased. The~\textcite{schultz2007constructive} study motivates us to examine the role of the comic form, a highly expressive, affective medium, in communicating messages intended to stimulate a specific behavior.

\textcite{scott1993understanding} defines comics as ``juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer."  The simple and humorous nature of a comic makes it a unique medium for delivering informative and memorable messages; the use of metaphor in comics can make the underlying meaning vivid and more memorable than using a straightforward description~\parencite{McDermottPB18,scott1993understanding}. There has been significant prior work in educational contexts: illustration of scientific facts~\parencite{McDermottPB18}, educating end-users about computer-security\footnote{Also used in introducing software: see~\url{https://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/big_00.html} for an example.}~\parencite{Zhang-Kennedy:2017:SCI:3206217.3206282}, communicating with multi-lingual audiences~\parencite{cary2004going, miguel2005ethnic}.

Despite the importance of the comic form in contemporary culture, and the use of the comic form in educational settings, there is surprisingly limited work examining the effects of the comic form to stimulate behavior. In particular, we focus on the use of an abstract comic form. By an abstract representation, (see~\Cref{fig:intro} for an example) we mean that the comic de-emphasizes character detail (face, eyes, etc.) or details about the locale. As~\textcite{scott1993understanding} points out, using abstract representations for the comic allows the reader to project themselves onto the comic character. The abstract form has an additional benefit: since the form is visually spare, it allows for comic panel algorithmic synthesis and the personalization of messages. In this paper, we used a three-panel comic in abstract form.

How should we decide on the experimental context in which we could examine the effects of the abstract comic form in stimulating behavior? There are many different compelling behavioral contexts: personal wellness goals (e.g., diet, exercise), mundane tasks (e.g. ``pick up dry cleaning''), as well as broader public-goods issues (e.g. ``take the flu shot;'' ``donate to cure cancer'')

Four design principles guide us, in our choice of the experimental behavioral context: nature of the reward; single shot tasks that preclude habit formation (a potential confound); an ecologically valid task; absence of specialized knowledge to perform the task. First, we would like the rewards to be distant, and non-exclusive, rather than proximal and exclusive so that individuals don't perform the task in anticipation of the immediate reward. Thus public goods dilemmas (e.g. ``reducing carbon footprint;'' ``taking the flu shot''; ``contributing to public knowledge'') are all candidates. Second, while some longitudinal tasks (e.g., losing weight; eating healthy) have distant rewards (losing weight, or maintaining a diet takes time), and can positively affect the public good (with more healthy people, in the long-run, insurance rates will fall), these tasks are prone to habit formation, a potential confound. Furthermore, single-shot tasks such as ``pick up yogurt at the grocery store today'', often prompted by text reminders from our calendars or task-tracking apps, have an immediate, exclusive reward. Third, we would like to ensure that the experimental task is ecologically valid---a task that these individuals would be actually asked to perform in the wild, outside of the experimental context. Fourth, we would like the task not to require specialized knowledge (e.g. ``asking doctors to make a decision''), so that other researchers could easily replicate and scale our experiment. Online charitable donation tasks satisfy these design principles as they are single-shot tasks, contribute to the public good with distant, non-exclusive rewards, occurs frequently, and easily tested for at scale. We chose a charity associated with Autism (Organization for Autism Research) for our experiment.

Thus, in this work we answer two research questions in the context of the online charitable donation task:
\begin{description}
    \item[RQ1:] Does the use of the abstract comic form increase the level of donation over the plain text message?
    \item[RQ2:] What is the effect of introducing a social norm in the abstract comic, when compared to the comic without the social norm?
\end{description}

We would like to emphasize that it is unclear at the outset if a message in comic form ought to make any difference say towards a charitable donation. An argument in favor is that comics communicate affect well and are an important element of our visual culture; an against is that from rational actor theory in classical Economics, since the comic includes the text message used in the text-only condition and thus cannot alter the expected utility, the comic ought to serve as an irrelevant factor. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first study looked at the persuasive power of abstract comic in online persuasive task with distant and non-exclusive rewards. 

We ran the experiment using Amazon Mechanical Turk ($n=307$; we paid each participant above minimum wage, at \$10.0/hr) where we randomly assigned each participant to one of the three conditions ('a plain text message', 'abstract comic', 'abstract comic with social norm'). The two comic conditions include the text used in the plain text condition. The social norm case adds one additional phrase to the comic that reveals the norm.

We performed a careful Bayesian analysis to analyze the data. We agree with the observations by~\textcite{Kay2016}, that beyond the impact on experimental replicability, shifting the question from ``did it have an effect?'' to ``how strong was the effect?'' is important to the HCI community. Two additional ideas---transparency, impact small-$n$ studies---motivate us to use Bayesian analysis. First, with a Bayesian model, the researcher foregrounds all the aspects of the model; there are no modeling assumptions that need checking, not already foregrounded in the model description. Thus the model and the results are amenable to further scrutiny. Second, a Bayesian model is valid at \textit{every} value of $n$ (the number of observations); we do not have to wait for $n\geq 30$ to satisfy assumptions of Normality. For small $n$ values, the result is of course affected by the choice of the prior; but by using weakly informative priors, we can ensure that the prior doesn't dominate inference. In a sense, Bayesian models make the \textit{most conservative} inference given the data~\textcite[][Chapter 9]{McElreath2015}.

We would like to emphasize that Non-Bayesian statistics are powerful tools, and when used by an experienced statistician, they can dramatically simplify the process of inference. However, for researchers who wish to investigate their findings without access to a statistician, they need to be careful of the assumptions of the different tests: Normality ($t$-test); heteroscedasticity (e.g., ANOVA) and ensuring that the data satisfy the assumptions required by the test; not doing so, can result in misleading inference.


\textbf{Our findings:} We show that using the comic has a meaningful increase in donations over the plain text conditions, with a medium to large effect size of $0.59$. Thus we can answer \textbf{RQ1} affirmatively. To answer \textbf{RQ2}, we show that while the comic with social norm increases the donation level over the comic without the norm, the effect size is very small ($0.11$) and the increase is not meaningful. To summarize, the comic form meaningfully increases donations over the plain text, but the presence of the norm is not effective. We caution that the result holds for single-shot, public goods tasks. To fully understand the value of incorporating the social norm in the comic, for specific longitudinal tasks such as exercise, or dieting, we need future research.  

\textbf{Design Implications:} The primary design implication of our findings: helping non-profits and Governmental agencies with their online messaging strategies as they work to alleviate public goods dilemmas. In particular, public-goods dilemmas that require single-shot decisions (online charitable donations; taking the flu shot) are opportune candidates for intervention. We believe that these agencies can easily include the use of the comic form as part of their overall messaging strategy because the simplicity of the abstract comic form allows it to be easily synthesized (as we discuss towards of the end of this paper) and to additionally incorporate social norms. 


The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss related work.~\Cref{sec:relatedwork} introduces two motivating ideas: the abstract comic form, and the idea of the social proof.\Cref{sec:Method} introduces our experimental method and in~\Cref{sec:Study on Behavior Results} we present our Bayesian analysis. In~\Cref{sec:Model Criticism}, we analyze the model for convergence and also discuss alternative models.~\Cref{sec:Discussion} summarizes the main findings, identifies limitations and then discusses how we could algorithmically synthesize the comic panels. We present our conclusions in~\Cref{sec:Conclusion}.
