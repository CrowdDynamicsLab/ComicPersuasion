# quick notes 

comics: juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information, and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer. (understanding comics, page 9); a distinction made between single panel (comic art), vs. comics (a sequence of stills, page 20])

when you enter the world of the cartoon, ... you see yourself. (p. 36)
our goal was to communicate a sense of time through the sequence, hence the gutter between panels, and the transitions match on action

time flows in two ways: vertically in each panel through the dialogue between the characters and across panels.
