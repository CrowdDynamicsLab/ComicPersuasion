Interest in the role of technology in behavior
change has been growing over the recent years.
Social network users are exposed to massive
information while they are reading their
newsfeed and interacting with their friends.
Attracting people's limited attention has been
a critical question in online persuasive technology.
Previous works have demonstrated that messages are
more attractive in a graphical form than plain text,
however, whether the comic messages can persuade the
reader and engage behavior change remains unknown.
This paper presents a research on the persuasiveness of
comic style messages. We showed that people perceive a message as more
persuasive when it is in a comic form than in plain text.
Then, we further investigated how different elements in
a comic message could influence the persuasive power of the message.
